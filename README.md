# Fraud Detection – PFAI Project

This project is developed as part of the **Practical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence (PFAI)** course.  
It focuses on detecting **fraudulent transactions** using **machine learning techniques**. Fraud detection plays a vital role in financial systems, e-commerce, and cybersecurity by preventing losses and ensuring trust in digital platforms.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives
- Analyze transaction datasets and identify fraud patterns.  
- Apply **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.  
- Build and evaluate different **machine learning models** for fraud detection.  
- Compare model performance using standard metrics such as **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC**.  

---

## 🔹 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline.  
- Multiple classification algorithms implemented (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.).  
- Visualizations for fraud vs. non-fraud transaction patterns.  
- Evaluation metrics for fair model comparison.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**
